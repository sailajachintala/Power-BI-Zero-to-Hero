### Cardinality
While Modelling the Data,we need to know the exact relationship between the 2 Tables. 

PowerBI Automatically Identifies the exact relationship based on the cardinalities. 
If you want to know the type of relationship (or) exact relationship (or) correct relationship between two tables then we need to identify the 
cardinality between 2 tables. 

### Cardinality Types: 
Cardinalities are divided into four different types. 
 #### **One to One** : 
 If one value in the first table is having or relating to maximum of only one value in the second table then it is known as ‘One to One’. 
 #### **One to Many** :  
 If one value in the first table is relating to maximum of multiple values in the second table then it is known as one to Many.
#### **Many to One** :  
If many values in the first table is having (or) relating to single value in the second table then it is known as ‘Many to One’.
#### **Many to Many**: 
If one value in the first table is having multiple values in the second table which in turn one value in the second table associating to multiple values of the first table, Hence for multiple values in the first table will be associating multiple values in the second table then such a kind of cardinality is known as Many to Many.
