**Scenario**: Lets consider a real time example of banking system to understand Datawarehouse architecture. SBI bank is located in different locations across the globe with several branches in each location. For this understanding, lets consider that this bank is operating in the US, UK, and India. 
Now the top management of SBI bank would like to know their business across different locations to identify in which location the business is doing good and where they need to focus to increase the running business.
